# Brazil E-Commerce Analytics Project

## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset (by Olist)** to uncover insights into online retail operations in Brazil. The analysis focuses on three main areas:

1. **Product performance** — identifying top-performing product categories.
2. **Order fulfillment** — examining order processing and shipping timelines.
3. **Delivery efficiency** — evaluating delivery patterns and delays across regions.

By exploring these aspects, the project aims to help e-commerce stakeholders improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and strategic decision-making.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries

The analysis was conducted using **Python** and the following libraries:

* **pandas** – data cleaning and transformation
* **numpy** – numerical computations
* **matplotlib** & **seaborn** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive data exploration

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains detailed information about:

* Orders, payments, and delivery times
* Product categories and prices
* Customer locations and seller data
* Customer reviews and feedback

---

## 🔍 Key Analyses

* **Data Exploration & Cleaning:**
  Checked for missing values, data types, and overall consistency.

* **Product Category Insights:**
  Identified top-selling categories and analyzed sales distribution.

* **Order Fulfillment:**
  Measured average time between order purchase, approval, shipment, and delivery.

* **Delivery Performance:**
  Analyzed delivery delays and regional trends.

* **Customer Satisfaction:**
  Investigated relationships between delivery time and review scores.

---

## 📊 Visualizations

The notebook includes multiple visualizations to support findings, such as:

* Bar charts showing product category performance
* Histograms of delivery times and payment values
* Heatmaps illustrating correlations among variables


## 🧠 Insights & Recommendations

* Logistics optimization can significantly reduce delivery delays.
* Categories like electronics and furniture show high sales volume but longer fulfillment times.
* Faster delivery correlates strongly with higher review ratings.

---

## 📈 Future Work

* Develop a **Streamlit dashboard** for interactive data visualization.
* Incorporate **machine learning models** to predict delivery delays or customer ratings.
* Compare results with newer datasets for trend analysis.
